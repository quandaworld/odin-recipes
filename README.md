Simple Recipe Website

This project is to apply all the HTML knowledge I have acquired through The Odin Project's Foundations Course to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

In this project, I have demonstrated the following HTML skills:
- Writing the basic boilerplate for an HTML document
- Creating paragraphs
- Creating headings
- Creating unordered and ordered lists
- Creating links to pages on other websites on the internet
- Creating links to other pages to my own websites
- Displaying images on webpages using HTML
